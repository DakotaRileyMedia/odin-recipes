# odin-recipes

This is the first project I am completing as part of The Odin Project curriculum, and this project is meant to demonstrate the HTML coding abilities I have gained by going through the first portion of this project. The website I am creating is a recipes website with a homepage that will link to a few pages with recipes on them.
