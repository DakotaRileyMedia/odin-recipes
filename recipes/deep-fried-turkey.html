    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is an awesome Cajun recipe. Deep-frying makes the turkey crispy on
      the outside and super juicy on the inside (even the white meat). It also
      leaves the heat outside! You can deep-fry the turkey in either peanut or
      vegetable oil, your choice. We use a 26 quart aluminum pot with a drain
      basket.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 gallons peanut oil for frying, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 (12 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed</li>
      <li>Â¼ cup Creole seasoning</li>
      <li>1 white onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large stockpot or turkey fryer, heat oil to 400 degrees F (200
        degrees C). Be sure to leave room for the turkey, or the oil will spill
        over. Layer a large platter with food-safe paper bags.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rinse turkey, and thoroughly pat dry with paper towels. Rub Creole
        seasoning over turkey inside and out. Make sure the hole at the neck is
        open at least 2 inches so the oil can flow freely through the bird.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the whole onion and turkey in drain basket. The turkey should be
        placed in basket neck end first. Slowly lower basket into hot oil to
        completely cover turkey. Maintain the temperature of the oil at 350
        degrees F (175 degrees C), and cook turkey for 3 1/2 minutes per pound,
        about 45 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully remove basket from oil, and drain turkey. Insert a meat
        thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh; the internal
        temperature must be 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). Finish draining turkey
        on the prepared platter.
