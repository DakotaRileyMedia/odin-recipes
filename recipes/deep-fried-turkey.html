    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is an awesome Cajun recipe. Deep-frying makes the turkey crispy on
      the outside and super juicy on the inside (even the white meat). It also
      leaves the heat outside! You can deep-fry the turkey in either peanut or
      vegetable oil, your choice. We use a 26 quart aluminum pot with a drain
      basket.
