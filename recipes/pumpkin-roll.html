      <li>sugar</li>
      <li>pumpkin puree</li>
      <li>cinnamon</li>
      <li>all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>baking soda</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling</h3>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bake the Cake: Mix the eggs, sugar, pumpkin, and cinnamon in a bowl. Mix
        the flour and baking soda in a separate bowl, then add it to the egg
        mixture. Blend the batter until smooth. Spread the batter in a prepared
        jelly roll pan. Bake in a preheated oven until the cake springs back
        when touched.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll the Cake: Invert the cake onto a cotton tea towel. Let the cake
        cool for about five minutes. Roll the cake up in the towel jelly-roll
        style. Place the cake seam-side down and allow it to finish cooling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the Filling: Beat the cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, butter,
        and vanilla in a mixing bowl until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll the Cake Again: When the cake is cool, unroll it and evenly spread
        with the cream cheese mixture. Roll the cake up again without the towel.
        Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.
